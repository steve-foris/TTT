Hey Folks, i'm going try doing a new weekly post.

Tech Tips on Tuesdays! 

I often see "Learn Linux First" mentioned in the Devops posts on my feed, and I absolutely agree.

Here are a couple of tools that helped me learn by exploring right from the shell:
man -k <topic>
eg: man -k disk

Then man <command_of_interest> from that list to dive deeper. 
This is probably how I learned 80% of the stuff I know. 

There is also another very nice tool which can do a similar thing.
tldr gives some background info and focuses on usage examples for most commands

It’s available in both Debian and RPM-based distros as the tealdeer package.

[xxxx@xxxx ~]$ podman run -ti -h tldr fedora #Drop into Fedora container for demo
[root@tldr /]# yum -y install tealdeer &>/dev/null
[root@tldr /]# tldr -u
Successfully created cache directory path `/root/.cache/tealdeer`.
Successfully updated cache.

List some available pages:
[root@tldr ~]# tldr -l | grep [a-z] | head 
2to3
7z
7za
7zr
a2disconf
a2dismod
a2dissite
a2enconf
a2enmod
a2ensite
[root@tldr ~]# tldr 2to3 | head

  Automated Python 2 to 3 code conversion.
  This module has been deprecated since 3.11 and has been removed since 3.13.
  For reference, see: <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/8d42e2d915c3096e7eac1c649751d1da567bb7c3/Doc/whatsnew/3.13.rst?plain=1#L188>.
  More information: <https://manned.org/2to3>.

You can also search the pages by keyword, e.g. “disk”:

[root@tldr ~]# grep -il disk /root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/* | head
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/atop.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/balooctl.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/bcachefs.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/btrfs-device.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/btrfs-filesystem.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/caligula.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/certbot.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/cfdisk.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/dd.md
/root/.cache/tealdeer/tldr-pages/pages/linux/ddrescue.md

What is ddrescue?

[root@tldr ~]# tldr ddrescue | head

  Data recovery tool that reads data from damaged block devices.
  More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Invoking-ddrescue>.

  Take an image of a device, creating a log file:

      sudo ddrescue /dev/sdb path/to/image.dd path/to/log.txt

  Clone Disk A to Disk B, creating a log file:
...

[root@tldr ~]# 

That is very handy :)

You can learn a lot from directly inside the shell. 

Note: I piped most commands to "head" for brevity leave off the "| head" part of these commands to see the full output.

If you have other great Linux-learning tips, drop them below.
Have a fantastic day!

PS: Hey @LinkedIn it would be great to have code or markdown tags for shell / code sharing on this platform.
